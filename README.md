Month-to-month contracts, a lack of online security, and technical support appear to be positively related to churn. While tenure and two-year contracts appear to be negatively correlated.
It's interesting to note that churn appears to be adversely correlated with services like online backup, tech support, streaming TV, etc. that don't require an internet connection. 

### Grouping of customers who have ceased to use the service (Churned)

From the picture, it can be seen that there are 5 groups of customers who have already stopped using the service:

â€¢ Group 1 (Blue): This is a group of customers with low service life and low monthly expenses. making it possible to see that These customers are the kind who just come in and go out. not attached to the use of any camp service

â€¢ Group 2 (Green): This is a group of customers whose service life is in the middle to very long. and has a low monthly cost which these customers It's a small group if you look at the density. which is relatively sparse, not as much as other groups This group of customers may be general people. that income is not high and may stop using the service for some reason

â€¢ Group 3 (Red): This is a group of customers who have a low service life and have relatively high monthly expenses. This group of customers is the group that has the largest number. If you look at the density that is more than any other group The reason why this group of customers stopped using the service may come from The monthly fee used is high. And there are other camps that are cheaper. therefore discontinued the service

â€¢ Group 4 (Purple): This is a group of customers whose service life is in the middle level and their monthly expenses are quite high. The cause of termination of the service of this group of customers may be the same as the third group, which has too high a monthly fee. But there may still be some hesitation. or there are other reasons for switching to another camp causing this group of customers to remain in the service for a long time

â€¢ Group 5 (Gold): This group of customers is a very interesting group. because this group of customers has a long service life And there are also high monthly expenses. Which can be regarded as a good customer that should be kept and not to stop using the service This group of customers doesn't seem to care. Or how much is the cost problem? Therefore, the reason why the service fee is already high causes this group of customers to stop using the service. Therefore, it is not the cause of this group of customers but may be caused by the service or other reasons that should be studied further In order not to let these customers who are good customers In the future, stop using the service.
